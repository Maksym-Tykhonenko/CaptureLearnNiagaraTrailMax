		tag: 'Classic View',
		description: `Stand at the brink of Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side, where roughly nine-tenths of the Niagara River’s flow plunges over a 51-meter drop along a crest about 790 meters long. From this point the wind often carries a cold mist that shifts with changes in river volume and prevailing southwest winds; in bright conditions, fine droplets create the most reliable rainbows of the entire gorge. The bedrock at your feet is dolostone and shale of the Lockport Group, and the constant undercutting is why the edge marches upstream by centimeters each year, a pace moderated by twentieth-century flow control for power generation and erosion management.`,

		tag: 'Classic View',
		description: `Prospect Point looks directly across the American Falls, whose apparent height is reduced by a talus slope that formed after large rockfalls in the twentieth century. Water here typically descends in a broad white curtain broken by bedrock shelves, contrasting with the single sweeping curve of Horseshoe Falls. The platform’s orientation makes it a strong vantage for understanding the geometry of Goat Island splitting the river and for hearing the different acoustic signatures of Horseshoe’s continuous roar versus the harsher, granular crash of the American cascade.`,

		tag: 'Close-Up Detail',
		description: `This narrow island separates the American Falls from the slender Bridal Veil Falls, placing you only a few meters from both drops. On humid evenings the spray rises like luminous fog, a phenomenon early visitors called “lunar rainbows” when moonlight refracted through suspended droplets. The island’s handrails and low elevation make it one of the closest publicly accessible perches to any major waterfall in North America, and its vantage reveals how rock joints and bedding planes steer the lip’s micro-shapes.`,

		tag: 'Immersive Spray',
		description: `Boardwalks rebuilt each season lead to the “Hurricane Deck,” where the wind field created by falling water accelerates through gaps in the rock wall. The experience demonstrates splash aerodynamics as sheets atomize into droplets and create chill through evaporative cooling. Workers remove the structures before winter ice forms and rebuild them in spring, a cycle that reflects the river’s continued power to reshape the talus and scour anchors.`,

		description: `Set on the U.S. rim of Horseshoe Falls, Terrapin Point offers an oblique view into the plunge pool and the swirling lateral currents that sweep clockwise due to the river’s entry angle. Stabilization projects in the late twentieth century included infill and protective walls to counter extreme erosion here. On cool days the cross-breeze carries the plume so thickly that the river’s color shifts from jade to white within seconds, a reminder of how suspended air in water controls perceived hue.`,

		tag: 'Iconic Span',
		description: `Opened in 1941, the steel arch of the Rainbow Bridge crosses the gorge just downstream of the American Falls. From the pedestrian deck you can trace the gradient that drives the river into the lower rapids and note the tidy line where mist thins and visibility jumps. The bridge replaced a previous span lost to an ice jam in 1938, and its position gives balanced sightlines to both national parks and the colorful night illuminations that began as experimental displays and evolved into nightly shows.`,

		description: `This cluster of small, landscaped islands sits a short walk from the main falls yet feels secluded, with still ponds that mirror the sky. The area’s gentle paths, birdlife, and seasonal floral plantings offer a sensory contrast to the gorge’s turbulence. During the winter festival season, lighting installations transform the islands into a quiet counterpart to the roaring cataracts, and in summer the placid water surfaces are ideal for studying reflections and diffuse color from low sun.`,

		description: `A boardwalk at river level places you beside some of North America’s fastest surface water, where the Niagara River narrows and plunges through constricted dolostone ledges. Standing here, you can watch standing waves and explosive boils formed by hidden boulders and the gorge’s uneven floor. The rapids are rated Class VI for navigational difficulty, a category that exceeds conventional whitewater limits and illustrates how gradient, volume, and channel shape combine to produce extreme hydraulic features.`,

		tag: 'Natural Vortex',
		description: `High above a sharp right-angle bend, the river circulates in a large counterclockwise gyre known as the Niagara Whirlpool, with depths measured to roughly thirty-plus meters. The rotation varies with inflow from the rapids and seasonal river management upstream. The antique-styled cable car that crosses this span traces a line surveyed in the early twentieth century and remains a vantage where you can see the eddies peel off the main swirl and dissipate downstream into the lower gorge.`,

		description: `Trails here descend through a preserved Carolinian forest onto boulder fields of stratified limestone and dolostone, where glacial erratics and potholes tell a story older than the modern falls. The Glen’s shaded understory shelters spring ephemerals and migratory birds, while the open talus slopes offer views back to the whirlpool rim. The terrain showcases how the river has stepped its way upriver over millennia, leaving relict terraces as markers of former cataract positions.`,

		description: `Rising more than 150 meters above the park, the tower’s deck reveals the full planform of Horseshoe and American Falls, the grid of streets behind the hotels, and the long reach of the river south toward Lake Erie. On clear days you can distinguish the darker channel of the deeper Horseshoe chute from the paler flow along the American rim. The height makes wind shear and plume direction easier to read, useful for photographers planning sunset frames and night illumination shots.`,

		tag: 'Power & Engineering',
		description: `The Canadian generating complex east of the gorge channels river water through underground conduits to turbines, then returns it downstream, a design that produces large amounts of electricity while reducing visible disturbance near the falls. Its phased construction in the twentieth century expanded Ontario’s grid and, together with U.S. facilities across the river, created a binational system that diverts water primarily at night and in winter to balance scenic flow with energy demand.`,
